# Building the Web of Things - Code
This repository contains all the Node.js and JavaScript code examples from the [Building the Web of Things](http://book.webofthings.io) book.

# Node version compatibility
This code is meant to work with **Node 4.x** and will not work on newer Node version. You can find the 4.x releases on https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/. We are working on a version that will support newer Node but it isn't quite ready yet.

# Downloading the code examples

# What is the book about?
The book is all about building apps for the Internet of Things using Web technologies. 
In more technical terms it is all about Node.js, JavaScript, HTTP, WebSockets for embedded devices!
